The learning objective for this practice exercise is to use display:flex on a list component, and then add additional CSS properties to achieve a desired layout.

Coffee Houses UI/UX Challenge

This is an optional challenge once you meet MVP. Make a new Github branch for this challenge.

Creating visual hierarchies.

Add an address, phone number, website link, and menu link to each coffee house (you may use mock/fake data).
Each coffee house component should utilize Flexbox for the layout.
Use semantic HTML and CSS to style each coffee house component with the goal of easy scannability. Consider which semantic tags you will use for each piece of content. At a minimum, you will emphasize the name of each shop and make the links clearly clickable.
Since you are defining several styles for the coffee shop component, write the CSS in shop.css and use @import to include those styles in the main CSS file.
Background color/image - ensure the copy (text color) has good contrast and is legible. Use the Dev Tools to inspect your color choices. (see dev tool image above).
